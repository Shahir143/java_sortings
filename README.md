Sorting in Java
1.Bubble sort
2.Insertion sort
3.selection sort
4.Merge sort
5.Quick sort


2=alt+0178
Time complexity 
0(1) when the loop exits on a single statement and it is not dependent on the input size it is constant time
0(log n) when the variable is divided or multiplied by a constant amount 
0(n) when the loop is increment or drecrement by a constant amount it will done completly 
0(n log n) when the outer loop is increment and inside the inner loop variable is divided or multipled by a constant amount
0(nÂ²) when the outer loop is increment and inside the inner loop variable is increase or decrease
0(2n) The growth rate double with each addition to the input(n),Any time unit increase by 1,the number of operations executed is double
0(n!) the loop doesnt exist. it is horrible case and worst case
