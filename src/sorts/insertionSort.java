/*
    Insertion sort: Time complexity is 0(nÂ²) .
 * it works similar to th e sorting of playing cards if we assume that 
 * first card is already sorted in the card game then we select unsortedcard
 * if wwe selected unsorted card is greater than the first card or previous card ,it will placed at the right side. 
 * otherwise it will be placed at the left side 
 * similarly all unwanted cards are taken and put in the exact places
